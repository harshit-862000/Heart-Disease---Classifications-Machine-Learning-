# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various clinical features. It explores the heart disease dataset, conducts data preprocessing, and applies multiple machine learning classification algorithms to build robust predictive models. The project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), model comparison, and evaluation of healthcare data.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations for feature and target distributions
- Data cleaning, normalization, and categorical variable encoding
- Implementation of multiple classifiers:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
- Model performance evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix visualization and model comparison

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
    - Load and inspect the dataset (`heart.csv`).
2. **EDA & Visualization**
    - Analyze and visualize feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Handle categorical variables with one-hot encoding
    - Normalize numerical features
4. **Model Training & Testing**
    - Split data into training and testing sets
    - Train multiple classifiers and assess accuracy
5. **Model Comparison & Evaluation**
    - Compare test accuracies and confusion matrices
    - Identify the best-performing models

## Results
- Highest accuracy achieved was **88.52%** using KNN and Random Forest classifiers.
- Visualizations provide insights into feature impact on heart disease prediction.
- Demonstrates practical steps for healthcare data analysis and ML implementation.
